# Housing-price-predictions

## Overview
This project uses regression models to predict housing prices from factors like square footage, age, bathrooms, school ratings, and crime rates, finding that a second-order model best explains price variation for real estate analysis.
Created as a project for MAT 303 at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

Key variables include price, living area, upper-level area, age, bathrooms, view, school rating, and crime rate.

## Models / Methods
1. **First-order regression**

2. **Second-order regression**

3. **Nested F-tests**

## Technology used
1. R

2. Jupyter notebook

## Results 
The second-order model was found to best explain price variation. 
Using the second-order model, we can predict the price of homes in an area using data on crime rates and school ratings that can be gathered in mass for various locations.
