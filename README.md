# Housing-price-predictions

## Overview
This project uses regression models to predict housing prices from factors like square footage, age, bathrooms, school ratings, and crime rates, finding that a second-order model best explains price variation for real estate analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

## Models / Methods
1. First-order regression

2. Second-order regression

3. Nested F-tests

## Results 
The second-order model was found to best explain price variation. 
Using the second-order model, we can predict the price of homes in an area using data on crime rates and school ratings that can be gathered in mass for various locations.
